"You Don't know JS" is a series of 6 books written by Kyle Simpson (getify) that teach you JavaScript.

I made this webpage so you can more easily read the markdown files that are publicly available under [https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

Consider buying a copy of the 2nd edition since Kyle Simpson is publishing the books for free under a Creative Commons 4.0 license.
